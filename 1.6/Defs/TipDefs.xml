    <tips>
      <li>If you have a colonist with the Skulker trait, bring them along on your caravans. Each Skulker lowers the chance the caravan will be detected and ambushed by hostile parties, and when the Skulkers leave the caravan they will temporarily become invisible. Caravans with Skulkers have additional options for interacting with various kinds of world sites, including settlements.</li>
