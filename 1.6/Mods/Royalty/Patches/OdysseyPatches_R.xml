									<description>Capable of sudden and unnatural movements, {PAWN_nameDef} can dodge blows with ease and jump far further. {PAWN_pronoun} can even leap great distances without the aid of artifacts or spells.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} also has some degree of control over the forces of mass levitation, allowing {PAWN_objective} to suppress the destructive forces caused by the ascension of flying buildings. To do this, {PAWN_pronoun} must remain on the ground while the structure takes off.</description>

									<description>Animals randomly become tame in the presence of {PAWN_nameDef}. This effect can occur over long distances, and its frequency is based on {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity.\n\nWhen {PAWN_pronoun} affects an animal with a spell, its health is either boosted (if non-hostile) or impaired (if hostile).\n\nThis animal-compulsion magic also affects local fish populations, causing them to breed more rapidly.</description>

									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} is surrounded by winds that hold {PAWN_objective} and nearby allies aloft, keeping them from triggering traps and allowing them to move faster, heedless of the difficulty of the terrain.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} can use this wind-aura to suppress the destructive forces caused by the ascension of flying buildings. To do this, {PAWN_pronoun} must remain on the ground while the structure takes off.</description>

									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} periodically conjures tame animals of a specific type to {PAWN_possessive} location. This effect occurs faster while meditating. New animals won't be summoned if doing so would cause the sum body size of all current ones to exceed twice {PAWN_possessive} attunement level.\n\nThis conjuration magic also gradually helps replenish local populations of fish.</description>

									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} can induce sudden and unnatural movements in {PAWN_possessive} body, making {PAWN_objective} faster and better at dodging, allowing {PAWN_objective} to travel much farther with jump abilities, and even allowing {PAWN_objective} to leap great distances under {PAWN_possessive} own power.\n\nThis power appears to be gravitic in nature, allowing {PAWN_objective} to cancel out the destructive effects of a gravship lift-off. To do this, {PAWN_pronoun} must remain on the ground while the ship takes off.</description>

									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} intermittently psychically tames a random animal. This effect can occur over long distances, and its frequency is based on {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity.\n\nWhen {PAWN_pronoun} affects an animal with a psycast, its health is either boosted (if non-hostile) or impaired (if hostile).</description>

									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} is surrounded by a field of selectively weakened gravity, allowing {PAWN_objective} and nearby allies to hover (allowing them to ignore terrain movement penalties), and preventing them from triggering traps.\n\nThis gravitic field also cancels out the destructive effects of a gravship lift-off. To do this, {PAWN_pronoun} must remain on the ground while the ship takes off.</description>

New animals won't be summoned if doing so would cause the sum body size of all current ones to exceed twice {PAWN_possessive} psylink level.\n\nThis skipgate system also gradually helps replenish local populations of fish.</description>
