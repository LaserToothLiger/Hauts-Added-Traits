									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} is surrounded by winds that hold {PAWN_objective} and nearby allies aloft, keeping them from triggering traps and allowing them to move faster, heedless of the difficulty of the terrain.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} can use this wind-aura to suppress the destructive forces caused by the ascension of flying buildings.</description>

								<value>
									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} can induce sudden and unnatural movements in {PAWN_possessive} body, making {PAWN_objective} faster and better at dodging, allowing {PAWN_objective} to travel much farther with jump abilities, and even allowing {PAWN_objective} to leap great distances under {PAWN_possessive} own power.\n\nThis power appears to be gravitic in nature, allowing {PAWN_objective} to cancel out the destructive effects of a gravship lift-off.</description>

								<value>
									<description>{PAWN_nameDef} is surrounded by a field of selectively weakened gravity, allowing {PAWN_objective} and nearby allies to hover (allowing them to ignore terrain movement penalties), and preventing them from triggering traps.\n\nThis gravitic field also cancels out the destructive effects of a gravship lift-off.</description>
